A cease and desist letter is a document sent to an individual or business to stop purportedly illegal activity ("cease") and not to restart it ("desist"). 
The letter may warn that if the recipient does not discontinue specified conduct, 
or take certain actions, by deadlines set in the letter, 
that party may be sued.[1][2] When issued by a public authority, 
a cease and desist letter, being "a warning of impending judicial enforcement",
[3] is most appropriately called a "cease and desist order".
